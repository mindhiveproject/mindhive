MindHive is a collaborative research platform for students, educators, and researchers. We offer tools, mentorship programs, and educational materials to bring together experts and non-experts to co-design studies, collaborate in data collection and analysis, and communicate study outcomes. MindHive's mission is to help promote a healthy science ecosystem by including all stakeholders in all steps of the research process.

If you are an educator and you want to know more about our programs for your classroom, see the <a href="/teachers">For Teachers page</a>.

If you’re an organization interested in partnering with behavioral scientists, neuroscientists, or youth to co-design behavioral science research projects, please reach out to us at  [info@mindhive.science](mailto:info@mindhive.science)

MindHive is supported by the National Institute of Mental Health Science Education Partnership Program (R25 MH135446-01), the US National Science Foundation (NSF #1908482 and #2241751) and the Learning Agency’s Tools Competition. MindHive is spearheaded by Drs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.suzannedikker.net/">Suzanne Dikker</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/camillia-matuk">Camillia Matuk</a> (New York University) in collaboration with lead developer Dr. <a target="_blank" href="https://iscience.uni-konstanz.de/team/yury-shevchenko/">Yury Shevchenko</a> (Konstanz University) and lead designer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimburgas">Kim Burgas</a>.

### **A participatory science program and platform for students, teachers, scientists, and communities**
Environmental NeWe will combine online and in-person tools to support authentic research experiences for youth from both urban and rural schools across the US, who will design studies that explore the relationship between our brains and the world around us (e.g., How is our brain health and wellbeing affected by our surroundings?). The program uses a participatory science approach, training the next generation of scientists to view individual and societal challenges not just as barriers, but as opportunities for research, innovation, and collaboration (<a target="_blank" href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/SN29ZULFFUSU5OR1aFTQiw/project-details/10665300">R25 MH135446-01</a>).

### **Preparing youth for the 21st century world: A collaborative research tool to build civic science and data literacy for learners and their communities**
We have assembled a team of designers, developers, scientists, and researchers across the USA and Latin-America to test and develop a globally scalable collaborative research platform. We will combine a participatory science learning approach with AI-supported behavioral science inquiry and data engagement tools to build youth’s data literacy, and support them in turning their sense of anxiety around big challenges into a sense of agency.

### **Crowdsourcing neuroscience: An interactive cloud-based citizen science platform for high school students, teachers, and researchers**
Current priorities in school science education include engaging students in the practices of science as well as the ideas of science. This project will address this priority by developing a cloud-based platform that enables high school students, teachers, and scientists to conduct original neuroscience research in school classrooms. Before students and teachers initiate their own studies using the system, they will participate in existing research studies by contributing their own data and collaborating with researchers using the online, interactive system. When experienced with the system, students and teachers will become researchers by developing independent investigations and uploading them to the interactive platform. Both student-initiated and scientist-initiated proposals will be submitted to the platform, peer-reviewed by students and scientists, revised, and included in the online experimental bank. In addition to conducting their own studies using the platform, scientists will act as educators and mentors by populating the experiment bank with studies that can serve as models for students and provide science content for the educational resource center. This online system addresses a critical need in science education to involve students more fully and authentically in scientific inquiry where they gain experience in exploring the unknown rather than confirming what is already known.

### **Promoting Students' Data Literacy through the Creation of Interactive Multimodal Representations of Biometric Data**
This project will promote data literacy in high school students by engaging them in learning about the Quantified Self -- the practice of using technology to track and reflect on one’s own biological, behavioral, physical, and/or emotional data. Learning activities will be designed to spark a broad interest in science and to help develop students’ informed opinions about the role of human-generated data in public life. To achieve this goal, the project will develop and test software tools as well as lesson and professional development materials with which students and teachers can explore, analyze, and create novel, multimodal, and interactive representations of data, recorded by wearable biosensing devices. Students will learn about how data from their bodies can be captured and interpreted through hands-on STEM activities that include the creation of interactive data representations. They will design and execute small exploration projects to answer their own questions and create offline and online artifacts to communicate their findings. During and after the project, instructors and students will have opportunities to connect with industry partners who work with biosensing and wearable technologies, and to access career and college readiness resources relevant to these and related data technology fields.
