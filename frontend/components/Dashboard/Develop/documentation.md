# Develop Area

## Overview  
The **Develop Area** is where you can create, customize, and manage the research tools you’ll use in your projects—such as studies, tasks, surveys, and blocks. You’ll access it from your dashboard, and it will guide you step-by-step through building or editing these assets.

## Main Sections  

- **Develop Home**: Shows an overview with a short description and quick options to start building new tools.  
- **What Do You Want to Build?**: Choose what you’d like to work on (study, task, survey, or block). Each option includes an icon, a short description, and links to get started.  
- **Start, Clone, or Upload**: For each type of asset, you can start from scratch, clone an existing one, or upload from outside sources. Each option is clearly labeled with helpful icons and instructions.  
- **Your Workspaces**: Displays lists of your studies, tasks, surveys, and blocks, organized in easy-to-browse panels.  

## How You’ll Use It  

- **Choose an Asset Type**: Click a card to pick what you want to create.  
- **Filter and Browse**: Use dropdown menus to filter between your own assets, shared ones, or examples.  
- **Quick Actions**: Use the buttons to create something new, upload, or clone.
