          MindHive is an online, open science, citizen science platform to
          support human brain and behavior science inquiry for learners and
          educators who seek authentic STEM research experiences. The MindHive
          platform features a suite of online tools that support learners’
          research activities, paired with teaching materials that illustrate
          and contextualize human brain and behavior research concepts and Open
          Science principles. The MindHive program emphasizes collaboration: it
          is co-designed by a team of educational researchers, teachers,
          cognitive and social scientists, UX researchers, and developers; and
          supports collaboration between students from schools across the

              <h2>Grace Church School</h2>
              <p>
                MindHive was first launched in March of 2020 as part of a pilot
                implementation with 17 Environmental Science students in
                Manhattan. New York City was the epicenter of the COVID-19
                pandemic and the MindHive team and students entered the US
                lockdown together and shifted to “zoom school”. The curriculum
                was (re)framed to use COVID-19 to illustrate scientific
                discovery in an ongoing crisis.
