# Review Tab

## Overview  
The **Review Tab** is where you can check feedback on your study proposal or tasks. It helps you understand what reviewers (like teachers or collaborators) think about your work and what changes you might need to make.

## Main Sections  

- **Review Panel**: Shows your submitted proposals or tasks, along with comments and feedback from reviewers.  
- **Feedback Center**: Once you submit your proposal, it gets locked for editing and becomes available for reviewers to comment on.  
- **Comments**: Reviewers can share suggestions, feedback, and updates about the status of your work.  
- **Status Indicators**: Each proposal shows a badge for its current status (e.g., Completed, In Progress, Help Needed).  

## How Youâ€™ll Use It  

- **Read Feedback**: Open your submitted proposal to see comments and suggestions.  
- **Track Status**: Check the status badge to know if your proposal is accepted, needs edits, or is still being reviewed.  
- **Make Updates**: If your teacher unlocks your proposal, you can edit and improve it based on feedback.
